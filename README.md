# Evaluating Accuracy of Exoplanet Detection Methods

This project analyzes data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to answer the question:  
**"Which exoplanet detection method yields the most consistent measurements for each orbital parameter?"**

## 🔍 Research Summary

Detection methods such as Radial Velocity, Transit, Microlensing, and Imaging yield multiple orbital parameters across confirmed exoplanets. This project:

- Aggregates measurements from different researchers for each exoplanet
- Calculates standard deviations of key orbital parameters per detection method
- Normalizes accuracy metrics for sample size and method representation
- Visualizes method-wise reliability across semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and more

## 📊 Tools & Skills Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Uncertainty Quantification & Error Propagation
- Scientific Visualization
- Data Normalization & Statistical Aggregation
